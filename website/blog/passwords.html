  Passwords- you like them or you hate them, we <b>all</b> have to deal with them (at least until hardware authentication becomes a thing).  So, what do I want to say about passwords? You're doing them wrong. Utterly and completely wrong.
<p>

  You reuse passwords. We all do it. It's so EASY to use the same (or a similar) password for every account. It's easy to remember,  you don't have to remember hundreds of complicated passwords and only you know it. Well...not exactly. You see, nowadays online platforms are getting breached all the time. Your password, associated with your email, is probably present in plaintext in a data breach anybody can access. You can find out how many of your passwords have been breached at this website- haveibeenpwned.com. If you're still using the same password across your accounts, one attempt to use the same credentials across sites (called credential stuffing), and you've been hacked.

</p>
  LinkedIn, Canva, Adobe, Yahoo and MANY other companies have been breached and their users' passwords exposed. My passwords have been exposed, your passwords have probably been exposed. So, the only possible method of keeping your accounts secure is to use long, randomly generated passwords that are different for each account. That way, when one service gets breached,  you don't lose your entire digital identity. But remembering all these passwords is impossible for any normal human being. This why there are only two recommended methods of creating and storing passwords- diceware and password managers. I won't go into diceware because it's not very easy to do or remember, but I will leave links for further reading at the end.
<p>
  The only realistic and convenient way to keep your accounts secure is to use a password manager. A password manager basically stores all your passwords(which are randomly generated and very secure) in an encrypted vault- either locally on your computer or on their servers. You simply have to remember one long master password that will decrypt the vault for you.
</p>
  You may have concerns with this, but I'm here to clear them. Let's break up the main reasons why people don't use password managers into three categories- convenience, security and plain old apathy.
<p>
  Apathy-
  By now, if you don't care about your email getting hacked and someone getting control of all your accounts, then I really have nothing to say to you. Keep in mind, for almost all your accounts, your email can be used to request a password reset. Your life can be taken over and your identity can be stolen just because you used "password123" for your email and your Minecraft account (this is not even a joke, Minecraft actually got breached).
</p>
<p>
  Convenience-

  This is probably the biggest reason people don't use password managers. Because they're "inconvenient". This is absolutely not true. You only have to remember one password, can autofill your details everywhere with just one click, and you can access your passwords from anywhere (if you're using a cloud-based manager). How is that inconvenient at all? I would argue it's actually more convenient than not using one.
</p>
<p>
  Security-

  Finally, we come to the reason I did not use a password manager despite knowing its benefits for months. I (and you for that matter) do not want to put all my eggs in one basket. So I tried using diceware to generate passwords for a while, but then, all those passwords were too many to remember, and I once again fell into the terrible habit of reusing my passwords. But then I realized something. By not putting all my eggs in one basket, and using the same password everywhere, I was putting all my eggs in many baskets.  That may sound a little weird at first, but if you think about it, by reusing the same password everywhere, you are literally putting all your passwords (because you've used the same one everywhere)  in the hands of every service you sign up for. Isn't it better to trust your passwords in one encrypted vault to one company whose employees can't even access your vault?

  Anyway, that was my rant about passwords and password managers. If you enjoyed it, consider subscribing- it's free and you'll receive an email when I put out a new post. I've left my recommendations and resources below. See you next time!
  If you've been convinced and want to start using a password manager, my recommendations are-
</p>
<p style="background-color:lightblue">
  Cloud based password manager (don't worry, this isn't the evil cloud I talked about earlier.) If you use this type of password manager, you'll be able to access your passwords from any device with an internet connection and a browser. My recommendation is Bitwarden- it's open source (I talked about this previously here) and most people don't need the premium features (aka it's a full fledged and free password manager).
  If you want to go to the maximum possible level of security, KeePassXC is the best open source local password manager, and it even has a browser extension.
