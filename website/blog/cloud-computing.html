Before I get into this, I just want to add a disclaimer that I believe backing up your data is EXTREMELY important. It is the only way to thoroughly protect yourself from ransomware, which is a type of virus I will cover in a later article. Right. Let’s get into it.
</p>
<p>
In order to be able to truly understand what the cloud is, and why storing your data in it might be concerning; we need to take a deep dive into the basics of cloud storage, as well as cloud security and privacy.
</p>
<p>
Oversimplified, a cloud is basically a computer located somewhere in the world. This computer is responsible for storing and transmitting your data.
</p>
<p>
But there’s a reason I said that was an oversimplification. The cloud, more accurately described, is a computer that has been stripped of all other functions except storing and handling your data. This kind of computer, called a server, usually runs some version of the operating system Linux, because it allows for extremely granular customization of what processes to run and what processes not to run.
</p>
<p>
To summarize, the cloud is a server built for dedicated data storage.
</p>
<p>
Now that the basic concepts have been dealt with, let’s understand why exactly storing your data in the cloud should be concerning to you.
</p>
<p>
Let’s tackle security issues first. There are a couple of main reasons why storing your data on the cloud may actually be worse than just storing your data locally on your device, even with the threat of ransomware.  The first and lesser important reason is access to your files. While getting access to files stored offline on a hard drive usually requires physical access to the device itself; the cloud can be accessed by anyone. From anywhere. That means your files will be accessible to absolutely anyone, as long as they have your username and password, which are surprisingly easy to obtain. (I’ll be talking about that in a later article on passwords.)
</p>
<p>
So that’s worrying, but Google and Apple, the two major cloud providers, have extremely thorough security practices that alert you if your account was signed into from an unfamiliar device. So, you probably don’t have to worry about that.
</p>
<p>
But let’s come to the second, more important issue. An issue on the side of the server storing your data. These servers are in constant contact with the Internet. While improbable, it is definitely possible that a malicious actor could upload malware or some form of spyware, that will steal/encrypt/delete/corrupt your files on the cloud. And the next time you try accessing them, boom. Your computer’s been injected with malicious code or software. And tech giants like Google or Apple aren’t immune to this either. Case in point, Google Drive (at the time of writing) does not support encryption for mobile devices, which means that if you’ve ever accessed your files on your phone, they were lying unencrypted on Google’s servers, vulnerable to malware.
</p>
<p>
Privacy goes hand-in-hand with security. Let’s analyse the privacy issues of storing your data in the cloud.
</p>
<p>
Google used to scan every single email in every single Gmail account, find keywords, and show you advertisements based on your emails. They, along with every other major tech firm, sell your data to third party companies in order to make a few bucks. Google CANNOT be trusted with your data and your files.
</p>
<p>
They do not employ zero knowledge end-to-end encryption, (similar to every other big tech firm), which basically means that some Google employees have access to everything you’ve ever uploaded to your drive.
</p>
<p>
That’s right. Their employees can see everything.
</p>
<p>
Every photo you’ve taken, every message you’ve sent (if you back up WhatsApp), and every video you’ve ever watched. Does that still sound worth it?
</p>
<p>
That is a serious breach of your privacy that virtually nobody should be comfortable with.  I hope you enjoyed the article and understood some of the implications of storing your data in the cloud.
Thanks for reading!
