Many consumers are gradually switching from desktops to laptops, thanks to increasing laptop performance and portability requirements. I wanted to write a short blog post on the qualities of an ideal laptop to create a convenient resource for my own as well as others' benefit.
</p>
<p>
There are five main considerations in the selection of a laptop. The ideal laptop would excel in all fields, but that isn't very realistic. The five fields are portability, performance, price, build quality and repairability. Cheap laptops typically achieve in two of these fields, good to great laptops achieve in four fields [to varying degrees], and [almost] no laptop excels in all fields.
</p>
<p>
Portability, Performance and Price are obvious categories for consideration. Build quality is an often-overlooked category. Build quality is important because at the end of the day, you aren't going to be interacting with the internal components much, but you'll be using the trackpad, keyboard and chassis the most. Repairability might be a slightly controversial category, but if you want decent longevity out of your device, you need the ability to repair it and/or upgrade the components when your hardware becomes outdated.
</p>
<p>
Having said that, my recommendations are:
</p>
<p>
1. A cheap laptop- Lenovo Ideapad 330s. All you have to do is switch out the HDD for an SSD, and you’re done. You have a fast laptop that is compatible with Windows and Linux. It also has decent upgradeability, such as an NVME slot, modular WiFi card, one empty slot of RAM and an easily detachable back panel. It has a good selection of ports and the keyboard is one of the best out there. It’s also fairly cheap. The cons are: moderate build quality and a terrible camera.
<br>
2. For all other price ranges, I recommend a Lenovo Thinkpad. The specs are normal for the price, and its upgradeability is standard. But the reason I recommend this line of laptops is the keyboard and the build quality. Since it’s made for professionals, it has a great build quality as well as an amazing keyboard. The ‘E’ series is the cheapest, and the ‘X’ series is the most high-end.

UPDATE: This was written before the release of the M1 Macbooks. If your price range is $1000 [or equivalent], just buy an M1. As long as you don’t care about repairability.
